# Video-Media-Player

This JavaFX library is used to make feature-rich internet apps (they offer similar experience and features as that of desktop apps). Like other Java libraries, the products built upon this library are platform independent, they can run on devices such as mobile phones, TVs, computers etc.

Other JVM based technologies like Groovy, JRuby etc can be used alongside JavaFX, however, the need seldom arises as JavaFX is offering most of the features itself. It is highly compatible with Java Swing, and its content can be embedded seamlessly in JavaFX apps.

Building a Media Player in JavaFX

For the media player application we would have three different classes the first one is our Main class which starts this application, then we have Player class to run our videos and audios and MediaBar class to control our media.
